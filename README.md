## Next Steps
Given more time, I would like to implement the following:

Multiplayer Mode: Allow two players to compete against each other.
Scoreboard: Track wins, losses, and mistakes over multiple rounds.
Animated Effects: Add animations for each guess and wrong attempt.
Difficulty Levels: Implement varying difficulty levels to make the game more challenging.
